a closure gives a function access to its outer scope. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

with this concept of closure we can optimise the code.

if there is change in funtion  then only call the function otherwise call the old one if there is no change this is happening by closure  


useCallback is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.

while calling function time to time it will create memory then it will take the process time. this will take some time so by this useCallback function when there is changed in function then only call otherwise use old function only.
